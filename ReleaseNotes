Release Notes for FreeNAS 9.2.1.5-RELEASE

All bugs fixed in 9.2.1.5-RELEASE can be found here:
	https://bugs.freenas.org/projects/freenas/issues?query_id=75

All bugs fixed in 9.2.1.4[.1]-RELEASE can be found here:
	https://bugs.freenas.org/projects/freenas/issues?query_id=60

Between these two queries, it should be possible to see all the
improvements done in 9.2.1-BRANCH over the last few months.  This is
hopefully the last release in the 9.2.1.x series, though of course we
will roll a 9.2.1.6 should any truly serious bugs be found that cannot
wait for 9.2.2.
